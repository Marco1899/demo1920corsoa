Silvio Micali 
Italia

Silvio Micali is a visionary whose work has contributed to the mathematical foundations of cryptography and has advanced the theory of computation. His non-conventional thinking has fundamentally changed our understanding of basic notions such as randomness, secrets, proof, knowledge, collusion, and privacy, which have been contemplated and debated for millennia. This foundational work was a key component in the development of the computer security industry, facilitated by his patents and start-up companies. His work has also had great impact on other research areas in computer science and mathematics.

Silvioâ€™s educational and teaching talents are no less legendary. His lectures are consistently entertaining and illuminating. They use numerous cartoons and remarkable stories of unlikely heroes, villains and impossible tasks, designed to highlight the new ideas and concepts. His strong Sicilian accent is the perfect spice for these treats. Silvio has mentored and advised many PhD students in that spirit.
